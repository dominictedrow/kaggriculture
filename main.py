"""Submitted agent's strategy follower: combined livestock + melon build.

Plain top-level agent(obs) function -- no factory/closure -- so it reads as
a flat, directly-editable action layout and stays picklable for
harness.run_matches()'s ProcessPoolExecutor.

v2: generalized the crew-assignment layer (was hardcoded to exactly 2
livestock hands + 1 melon hand) so ANIMAL_MIX and hand counts can scale --
needed to chase a higher money target than the original 6-animal/19-melon-
tile build could reach. Sizing rationale (see RULES.md's Price Function
table): each glut-prone product's price floors once cumulative season sales
pass roughly its `T` throughput constant. At this build's yield rates,
wool's T=105 and milk's T=122 support far more animals before crashing than
melon's T=300 supports tiles (melon's higher yield/tile/day burns through
its bigger T just as fast) -- so the scale-up lever is more livestock, not
more melon. NE land ($1k) is bought to give melon room now that a bigger
herd claims more of NW.

AB-tested via test_gen.py (see ab_rounds/round4-15*.json) across two passes:

Pass 1 (round4-7): scaling the herd past ~14 animals backfired at first
(round5's 18/21-animal configs crashed to $16k-69k -- ongoing daily wheat
OPEX outpaces revenue before the bigger roster pays off), and a single melon
hand became the bottleneck once the herd grew (round6: 2 melon hands beats
1). round7 (n=30) confirmed winner: 82,793 combined mean, beating the
original 6-animal/1-melon-hand build's 60,970 by +36%. Also fixed a real bug
found along the way: wheat purchases were gated on `money > 0`, so a big
enough one-time spend (animals + land) could zero the cash out and then
*permanently* block wheat buying, starving the whole herd to death (2 unfed
days = animal escapes, unrecoverable) with no way to recover -- wheat is now
funded first, before animals/land get whatever's left.

Pass 2 (round8-15, chasing a 95k target): added nearest-need routing (was
walking to the first needy tile in index order, not the closest one) and an
urgency tier (an unfed animal/unwatered-young-melon is one missed day from
irrecoverable loss, so it now always outranks routine harvest/care) -- a real
correctness fix, but its measured effect was within noise once confirmed at
scale (n=30), not a big lever on its own. Land-purchase timing/priority and
animal-purchase-pacing knobs were added and swept; none beat the original
"greedy, animals first" defaults. Re-sweeping herd size found a real (if
narrow) sweet spot at 17 animals (11 COW + 6 SHEEP, 6 hands) -- 18+ reliably
regressed again, this time because a bigger roster's upfront cost crowds out
land purchase entirely (confirmed: `unlocked_quadrants` stayed `['NW']` the
whole game in the 18-animal case). The one genuine additional win was sell
price gating (`SELL_MIN_PRICE_FRAC`): CONSOLIDATED_FINDINGS flagged this as
"worth testing" for glut-fragile goods and phase 1 never tried it at this
production volume -- holding melon/milk/wool instead of dumping them while
the price is beaten down below 40% of base beat dump-immediate by a
consistent, confirmed margin. n=50 confirm: 86,253 combined mean.

Pass 3 (round16-21, crop diversification, still chasing 95k): generalized
melon's tile-action into `_crop_action(crop, max_yield_day, ...)`, shared by
MELON/WHEAT/CARROT, and generalized the crew-assignment into `_CREW_PLAN` (a
flat hand-slot -> (job, tile-group) list) so any number of job types can
share the hire pool. Also found and fixed a real crash along the way:
standing on a still-locked tile (a plain "LOCKED" string, not a dict or None)
called `.get()` on it and raised AttributeError -- latent in melon's tile
pool too (it also reaches into NE) but never triggered until wheat's spare-
tile pool reached deeper into still-locked territory. Also found that HIRE
competes with every BUY_* for the same 10-orders/turn cap, and with hand
counts approaching double digits HIRE alone could fill it, silently dropping
every buy (and every sell) that turn -- fixed by giving each purchase
category its own hour instead of bundling them all into hour 0 (only HIRE
actually needs hour 0, since hands are hired once for the whole day).

The crop economics looked compelling on paper -- wheat barely reacts to glut
(T=400, above_target=0.2) so growing our own feed instead of buying it
looked like near-free money, and carrot's price pool is entirely separate
from melon's -- but none of it held up under confirmation. Small-n screens
(n=15) showed wheat self-farming beating baseline by several thousand
(round16/17), but every n=30+ confirm (round18/19/20) put wheat-alone,
carrot-alone, and the no-crops baseline within noise of each other
(81k-86k), and wheat+carrot combined together was outright worse and
unstable (round16: bimodal, stdev ~43k, sometimes $0). The marginal hand's
hire cost plus the crop-tending overhead apparently roughly cancels out
whatever wheat/carrot revenue they add at this scale -- this game's
per-episode variance (stdev commonly $7k-45k depending on config) is large
enough that a lever has to be worth several thousand dollars before n=30-50
can tell it apart from noise, and neither crop cleared that bar. Final
confirmed number, unchanged from pass 2: 86,810 combined mean (n=40,
consistent with pass 2's 86,253 at n=50) -- didn't reach the 95k target; see
the chat writeup for what a genuinely structural change (SW/SE land, a
different crew architecture) would need to try next.

Pass 4 (AB-confirmed regression, reverted): three changes drawn from
report.md's replay analysis of the real top-10 leaderboard (992+ episodes
across 3 distinct strategy families), not from phase-1 sweeps against
"random"/"starter" -- see CLAUDE.md's caveat on why that distinction
matters.

(1) BUY_LAND now targets 3 quadrants (NW+NE+SW, generalized from the old
NE-only BUY_NE_LAND flag) -- every top-10 family buys a 3rd quadrant by
day 9-11 using the same "retry every day until affordable" idiom this file
already used for NE, so this is that same proven idiom extended, not new
design. SE ($4k) is skipped for now -- no crew/tile plan built for it yet.

(2) Melon stops being replanted after MELON_EXIT_DAY (day 10) -- every
top-10 family abandons melon by day ~20 rather than fighting its permanent
glut (zero town demand, above_target=3.6), and since melon matures in
exactly 10 days, day-10 is the latest planting that still finishes near
that window. Already-growing melon is left to mature normally (no point
discarding a sunk seed cost); once a tile empties post-exit it gets WHEAT
instead, using the same hand/tile assignment with no crew restructuring --
wheat's price climbs all season on staple demand (RULES.md Price Function
table) rather than gluting, so this doubles as the "wheat as exit vehicle"
late-game pattern report.md found across the whole leaderboard, just
triggered by a day threshold instead of literally being end-of-season.

(3) The herd grows from 17 to 23 animals (11->15 COW, 6->8 SHEEP) with
livestock hands 6->7 (N_HIRES 8->9), chasing report.md's observed top-10
hand counts -- capped well short of that 12-14 range by a real constraint
report.md doesn't surface: HIRE cost is `fib(hires_today)` and hands drop
at end of day, so it's not a one-time cost, it's paid in full *every
single day* (RULES.md "Hiring" section). Going from 8 to 12 daily hires
looked like a proportionate scale-up but is actually a 7x jump in daily
hire spend ($54/day -> $376/day, $1,620 -> $11,280 over 30 days) --
confirmed by a direct sizing sweep (not just theory) that N_HIRES=12
reliably bankrupts the farm to $0 with 0 hands by day ~19, every seed
tried. The cliff sits between N_HIRES=9 ($88/day, safe across every seed
tried) and N_HIRES=10 ($143/day, reliably bankrupts) -- N_HIRES=9 is the
ceiling this pass uses. This probably means top-10 agents ramp hiring up
over several days rather than paying the full target's fib-cost from day
0 the way this file's HIRE block always has (report.md §4 hints at this:
Family C "only crossing 10 hands around day 12-13" despite a field-high
peak of 14) -- a gradual hiring ramp is the natural next lever if 9 hires
turns out to be the real ceiling under a fixed-target policy, but it's a
new mechanism, not a sizing tweak, so it's out of scope for this pass.
SW is unused by 23 animals (fits entirely in NW's 25 tiles) -- it exists
as forward-compatible overflow room (see _LIVESTOCK_POOL) for whenever a
future pass raises the target past 25, not exercised by this pass's
numbers. A 10-seed sanity check (not a real AB confirm -- see 1st.md's
"Measurement problem" on why n=10 can't settle this) put COW=15/SHEEP=8/
hands=7 at a 72,931 mean vs the original 17-animal/6-hand config's 69,315
over the same 10 seeds, with no bankruptcies either side -- directionally
fine, not a confirmed win; that's what the next thorough AB pass is for.

The thorough pass: `harness.compare_paired` (seeded, n=30) against a
reconstructed pass-3 baseline (COW=11/SHEEP=6, LIVESTOCK_HANDS=6,
LAND_TARGET_QUADRANTS=2, MELON_EXIT_DAY effectively off) found pass 4
*worse*, not better -- mean diff -18,518 vs `random` (stdev 36,065, n=30;
a real signal, not noise) and a statistical tie vs `starter` (+102, stdev
34,522). The 10-seed sanity check's apparent +3,616 edge didn't survive
proper n. Root cause not isolated (the three changes were bundled and
reverted together, matching `leader_clone`'s own lesson in 1st.md: copying
the leaderboard's output numbers -- herd size, quadrant count -- doesn't
automatically transfer to an economy that didn't produce them), but the
bigger herd's daily hire/feed OPEX and the 3rd quadrant's $2k up-front
land cost are the leading suspects, both competing with the same cash pool
BUY_LAND and HIRE already contend for. Reverted to pass 3's values below;
if a future pass wants this lever again, isolate and AB-confirm each of
the three changes independently rather than bundling.

Current replay-driven revision: expansion is now isolated from the earlier
herd-size experiment. It can expand through NW+NE+SW when the land purchase is
affordable, assigns the overflow crop slice in SW, stops melon/wheat planting
when the remaining season cannot repay them, and liquidates on day 29. Routing
now uses owned-cell paths, including recovery from a hand's locked spawn tile.
These are behavior/correctness changes requested from replay review; they are
not yet a paired-performance claim.
